                                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am an artist based in Pune. Though I did not pursue it as a
                                        part
                                        of curriculum and
                                        majored in Chartered Accountancy, it’s the childhood passion that makes me paint
                                        regularly. <br>
                                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I used to do sketching and poster color paintings since
                                        childhood
                                        when I was 6-7
                                        years old. Post my education, I started pursuing Art along with my job since
                                        2016.
                                        Currently I am learning from my Guru Vilas Kulkarni, who is also a renowned
                                        artist
                                        in India.

                                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Raja Ravi Varma is considered one of the most famous Indian
                                        artists in history. His paintings are known for depicting Indian women, as well
                                        as
                                        episodes from epic texts such the Mahabharata or Ramayana. One of his most
                                        well-known works is "Shakuntala". Shakuntala is a character in the Mahabharata
                                        who
                                        pretends to remove a thorn while searching for Dushyanta. Varma's unique ability
                                        to
                                        combine European academic techniques and Indian sensibilities has made his work
                                        widely admired.
